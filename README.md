# WHO-Cholera-Data-Analysis

Exploratory data analysis using the global data from WHO about the cholera incidence as well as sanitation and other water related indicators across different countries. To reaffirm the WHO guidelines for preventing Cholera using best sanitation and hygiene practices, the following questions were analyzed 

1. How has Cholera prevailed worldwide from 1949 to 2016?
2. What are the most adversely affected countries over these years?
3. Is there any correlation between the water and sanitation indicators and cholera incidences in this dataset?


## Programming language: Python

## Libraries used: 
1. pandas 
2. numpy 
3. matplotlib 
4. seaborn
5. functools

## Summary of the analysis: 
With this analysis, I have tried to look into the prevalence patterns of Cholera all over the world during 1949–2016 based on the data from WHO and conclude the following:

1. India is the top most country with majority of the incidences as well as death cases.
2. Bangladesh reported the highest number of deaths after India, though there were other countries with higher incidences
3. The correlation analysis shows that, it is mandatory to follow best hygienic practices such as safe drinking water, better sanitation and avoiding open defecation to prevent Cholera mainly in case of developing countries

## Limitations
Since, the data was limited, the conclusions are also limited to the data set collected.
